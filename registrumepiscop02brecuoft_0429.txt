LITERAE PAPALES, 415

if he assumed the habit, and conducted himself as a professor for the space
of three days, he should be· bound to demit all his ecclesiastical benefices with
or without cure3 and when therefore, in this way, the perpetual vicarage of
the parish church of Dunde, and the parish church or rectory of Kinel‚ belong-
ing to the dioceses of Brechin and St. Andrewss and held by the said Richard‚
were expected to become vacant, the Pope, in accordance with the tenor of
former letters of indulgence granted by him to John Spalding, dean of Brechin,
and for the sake of James, King of Scots, who had sought not only these
benefices, but also the bishopric of Dunkeld for the said John Spalding, his
councillor3 confessor, and master of his chapel, conferred‚ and hereby confers, the
said vicarage and rectory, with the yearly revenues thereof‚ which did not exceed
thirty pounds sterling for each, on the said John Spalding ; allowing him to hold
these two incompatible benefices in conjunction with the deanery for three years,
to resign the three all at once or one by one successively at his measure,
whether this were simply or for the sake of exehange, to receive in their stead
three other incompatible benefices, among which these two may be reckoned‚
not being, however, parish churches, or their perpetual vicarages, and to hold
these two, to wit, the parish church and vicarage, for seven years, and the third,
¹ if one of the three is not previously exchanged for a compatible benefice, for three
years, he being bound in case of no such exchange, wholly to demit, at the end
of the said three years, that one of the three which he first got ; and that not-
withstanding the same Pope had prohibited, with certain exceptions‚ any person
from holding together two parochial churches 01· two dignities, being either those
immediately under the episcopal in cathedral churches or the principal in col-
legiate churches, unless the parish churches were so contiguous as to be con-
veniently served by one person, and unless, also, their revenues did not exceed
the yearly value of twenty-four gold fiorins of the chamber3 dispensing with
all ecclesiastical statutes and customs to the contrary; but providing that the
foresaids deanery, vicarage‚ and church, should not be defrauded of the services
due to them3 and directing the bishops of Glasgow and Galloway, and the dean
of Rheims‚ to give the said John Spalding possession of the saids benefices
accordingly. Dated at St. Mai-ks, at Rome, l9th November, 1467.
