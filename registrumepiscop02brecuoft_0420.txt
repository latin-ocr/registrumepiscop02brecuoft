of the parish church of Dunde, in the diocese of Brechin, with its revenues
not exceeding thirty pounds sterling yearly, when it should become vacant
by the resignation of Richard de Cra-g vicar thereos, or by the constitution
of Pope John XXII. beginning “Execrabilis,'' provided no one had esta-
blished a legal right thereto, and that even although the said Gilbert was
known to hold the archdeaconry of Brechin and a canonry and prebend in
the churcb of Moray called the subchantorship, the [united] revenues of which
