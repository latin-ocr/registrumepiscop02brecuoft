LITERAE PAPALE S.

CCCCX. Bull by Honorius III. granted on account of the devotion manifested by Alex—
ander King of Scots and his predecessoris to the Holy See, whereby in accord-
ance with the example of his predecessors Celestine and Innocent, and con-
sidering that the Scottish Church‚ in which there were these episcopal sees, to
wit, the churches of St. Andrews, Dumblane, Glasgow‚ Dunkeld, Brechin,
Aberdeen, Murray, Ross, and Caithness‚ was subject immediately to the
Apostolic See, the Pope rigorously prohibits any one, except the Roman
Pontiff or his Legate a latere appointed fot· scotland, from promulgating a
sentence of Interdict or Excommunication in that kingdom, declaring it to be
null if promulgated ; and adds, also, that it shall not be lawful for any persons,
who do not belong to that kingdom, unless one specially appointed by the
Apostolic See out of its own body for that end, to exercise the office of Legate
in the kingdom3 forbids that any controversies which shall arise therein re-
garding any possessions in it be brought to trial before judges without the
kingdom, unless there is an appeal to the Chureh of Rome3 declax-ing that all
writs obtained or to be obtained against this· indulgence shall cause no harm

' thereto ; and confirms, mot-cover, all the libet-ties and immunities grant-ed and
hitherto observed by the Church of Rome to the King, the kingdom, and the
churches therein, saving, however, the authority of the Apostolic See. Given
at the Lateran, by the hand of Rancrius, Vice-Chancellor of the holy Roman
Church, 21st November, on the uh Indiction‚ in the 3rd year of the Pope’s
consecration, and in the year of the Incarnation of our Lord, 1218.
